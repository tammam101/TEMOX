ROLE:
Act as a Senior Full-Stack Developer and UI/UX Designer specializing in "Cyber-Minimalism."
PROJECT GOAL:
Build a high-performance, interactive, and responsive React website for "TEMOX" (Advanced IT & Cybersecurity Solutions). The site must feel "alive" with animations but remain professional and fast.
🛠️ 1. TECH STACK & ARCHITECTURE (The Logic)
• Framework: React (Vite) or Next.js.
• Styling: Tailwind CSS (for layout) + Custom CSS for neon glows.
• Animations: Framer Motion (Critical for smooth entry, hover, and page transitions).
• Routing: React Router (v6) with dynamic routing for service pages (/services/:slug).
• Icons: Lucide-React or Heroicons.
• Form Handling: Logic for EmailJS integration (simulate the API call with console.log and success state if API keys aren't present).
🎨 2. DESIGN SYSTEM (The Vibe)
• Theme: "Dark Future." Deep black/gray backgrounds (#0a0a0a to #1a1a1a).
• Accent Colors:
• Primary: Cyber Red (#ff2a2a)
• Secondary: Electric Purple (#7d00de)
• Highlight: Neon Blue (#00f0ff)
• UI Style: Glassmorphism. Cards and Navbars should have backdrop-filter: blur(10px), slight transparency, and thin distinct borders.
• Typography: 'Inter' or 'Orbitron' (headers) for a tech feel.
🧩 3. COMPONENT STRUCTURE & FEATURES
A. Navigation (Global)
• Sticky Navbar: Blurry glass effect on scroll.
• Links: Home, Services, About, Contact.
• CTA Button: "Get Started" (Glows on hover).
• Mobile: Hamburger menu with smooth slide-in animation.
B. Hero Section (Homepage)
• Visual: Dark gradient background or abstract mesh particles.
• Headline: "TEMOX – Advanced Technology & Digital Solutions" (Animate text appearance).
• Sub-headline: "Cybersecurity • Networking • Development • Smart Systems".
• Actions:
• Primary Button: "View Services" (Scroll to grid).
• Secondary Button: "Request Service" (Navigate to Contact).
C. Services Grid (Dynamic Component)
• Data Source: Create a servicesData array (JSON) containing ID, Title, Slug, Icon, ShortDesc, and FullDesc.
• The Cards:
• Glassmorphism background.
• Hover Effect: Scale up slightly (1.05), border glows Red/Purple.
• Click Action: Navigate to /services/{slug}.
• List of Services (Must Include):
1. Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking
2. Networking & Infrastructure
3. Software Development
4. IT Support & Maintenance
5. CCTV & Surveillance Systems
6. Smart Systems & IoT
7. Cloud & Server Solutions
8. Design & Branding
D. Dynamic Service Detail Page (/services/:slug)
• Logic: Don't hardcode 8 pages. Create ONE template component that renders data based on the URL parameter.
• Layout:
• Header: Service Title & Icon.
• Body: Detailed description (pass mock text for now).
• Sidebar/Bottom: "Ready to start?" CTA box linking to the Request Form with the service pre-selected.
E. "Request a Service" Form (Functional Logic)
• Fields: Full Name, Email, Phone, Service Type (Dropdown mapped to servicesData), Project Details, File Upload (UI only).
• Validation: Ensure Email is valid and fields are not empty before submitting.
• State Management:
• Idle: Show form.
• Submitting: Show loading spinner (disable button).
• Success: Show "Message Sent to t.__x@tammam.online!" with a checkmark animation.
• Error: "Something went wrong."
F. Footer
• Socials: Instagram (@t.__x), GitHub (@tammam101), Email (t.__x@tammam.online).
• Copyright: "© 2025 TEMOX. All rights reserved."
• Links: Quick links to services and "Privacy Policy."
🚀 4. ANIMATION GUIDELINES (Framer Motion)
1. Page Load: Staggered fade-in for hero elements.
2. Scroll: Section titles slide up as they enter the viewport.
3. Buttons: whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }} and whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}.
📝 5. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPER
1. Initialize the project using the specified stack.
2. Create the servicesData constant first.
3. Implement the Router.
4. Build the layout (Nav/Footer).
5. Build the Pages.
6. Ensure the Contact Form onSubmit logs the data object to the console (simulating the email send).
